# cppChessEngine
A slightly more complicated chess engine from the old.

Basic Chess AI, if you want to use this AI to get worse at chess you are free to do so.

You can see and anaylize some of the engines games here: https://www.chess.com/member/quarelai (Anything before July 2021 is from the old engine)

This engine has features allowing you to add/ modify your own opening books, and use custom search depth.

The library https://github.com/nkarve/surge#readme is used for move generation.
